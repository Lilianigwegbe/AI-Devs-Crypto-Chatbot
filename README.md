#  CryptoBuddy (An AI Enabled Crypto Guide)

CryptoBuddy is a **rule-based Python chatbot** that allowss users to assess cryptocurrency investment prospects based on **profitability** and **sustainability**. It responds to user enquiries like these using basic `if-else` logic:

1. “Which crypto is trending up?”  
2. “What’s the most sustainable coin?”  
3. “Which crypto should I buy for long-term growth?”

##  Features

-  Dialog interface with a friendly tone using Python `input()`.
-  Uses conditional logic to evaluate predefined data.
-  Suggests cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization and price trends.
-  Evaluates sustainability using a score and energy consumption.
-  Provides personalised suggestions without the need of sophisticated algorithms.
-  "Crypto is risky—always do your own research!" is added as a disclaimer.

## How It Works

The chatbot uses a **predefined dataset** that contains information on three cryptocurrencies:
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Cardano

It uses logic to:

Recommend **profitable coins** (trending + high market cap)

Recommend **eco-friendly coins** (low energy use + high sustainability score)

Suggest coins for **long-term growth** (rising + sustainable)
